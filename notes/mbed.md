# Notes on ARMmbed

## Related to examples and libraries
> Due to the complexity of the ARMmbed repository network. We've decided the easiest way to collect this information is to add a link inside of a `README.md` file that points to a related developer library on the [](https://developer.mbed.org). Unless ARMmbed chooses a repository technology that allows us to submodule code via git, there's not a better option.
